        <p class="center">Honkai: Star Rail (Chinese: 崩坏：星穹铁道; pinyin: Bēnghuài: Xīngqióng Tiědào; lit. 'Honkai: Star Dome Railway') is a role-playing gacha video game developed by miHoYo, published by miHoYo in China and worldwide by its subsidiary HoYoverse. It was released on April 26, 2023, for Windows and mobile devices; port for PlayStation 5 is planned with a Q4 release window, while the PlayStation 4 version is still yet to be announced, as revealed at the latest Summer Game Fest with a trailer. It is the fourth installment in the Honkai series, drawing on characters from Honkai Impact 3rd and gameplay elements from Genshin Impact.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>Honkai: Star Rail was revealed in October 2021 at the end of the Honkai Impact 3rd online concert, Starfire Sonorant, then later on the game's official YouTube channel.
        <br><br>
        The game entered its first closed beta testing later that month. A second closed beta test was held between May and June 2022. A final closed beta test was held in February 2023 and prior to the release of the game. In April 2023, HoYoverse announced having 10 million pre-registered users.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>Honkai: Star Rail follows the gameplay style of classic Japanese role-playing games: players build up a lineup of characters, and control a team of four in turn-based combat.Elements of open-world and dungeon exploration are present, with multiple mechanics, including the gacha system, carried over from HoYoverse's previous action RPG Genshin Impact.</p>

                        <p>The game is set in a science-fantasy universe in which humanity follows the paths of beings called Aeons. The player character, the Trailblazer, whose name and gender are chosen by the player, awakens without their memory aboard a space station and discovers that they are imbued with a Stellaron, a disruptive cosmic entity. They join a band of adventurers, the Trailblazers, traveling from world to world aboard the Astral Express, their space train.
                        <br><br>
                        The Trailblazer wakes up and meets two members of the crew, March 7th and Dan Heng. Both are traveling on the Astral Express, a large cosmic train that travels the universe along the eponymous "Star Rail". After eliminating the remaining threats, the Trailblazer meets Himeko, the Astral Express's engineer, and Welt, an interdimensional traveler from the Honkai Impact 3rd universe. In an attempt to discover their origins and eliminate the threats of the remaining Stellarons, the Trailblazer departs with the Astral Express crew.</p>

                                        The Aeons are godlike beings in Honkai: Star Rail who preside over the galaxy. Each Aeon is associated with a Path, by which they can use its energy as they please, but they are also bound to it for the rest of their lives.
                                        <br><br>
                                        People know very little about these mysterious existences that stroll through the vast stellar sea. Limited by inherent capacities of cognition, intelligent lifeforms can only faintly discern that Aeons tread upon Paths imperceptible to mortal beings and execute unfathomable powers via some form of belief. In legends passed down through word of mouth, the Aeons became the embodiment of highly condensed philosophical concepts in the end.
                                        <br><br>
                                        If anyone can tread on a Path ruled by an Aeon, they will be inundated by a distant sensation, like being struck by a glance from light-years away across the galaxy. Many believe that this is the only connection that Aeons and mortals can ever have with each other.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Path</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        "The birth of an Aeon gives rise to a Path. The nature of the Paths remains a mystery, leaving us to draw an analogy in a way that mortals can understand: It's a philosophical concept of sorts."
                                        <br><br>
                                        The Aeons can use Paths as they please after their ascension and are linked to it for the rest of their existence.
                                        <br><br>
                                        There are currently 18 known Paths, each with a corresponding Aeon and their own followers.

                                    <div class="divider"></div>

                                        A Stellaron is a mysterious object spreading across the universe like a cancerous growth, leading it to be nicknamed the Cancer of All Worlds by the Interastral Peace Corporation. Stellarons are considered seeds of disaster which cause massive changes to civilizations and ecosystems, and result in the appearance of Fragmentum.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Various factions had started to notice a phenomenon since a specific time. A vague, imperceptible matter was disrupting the flow of Imaginary Energy along the interstellar routes created by the Trailblaze. Like a mountain climber meeting a cliff or a long-distance ship encountering tsunamis and whirlpools, interstellar travel changed from being unobstructed to being dangerous and unpredictable.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The Stellaron Hunters, who serve an enigmatic individual known as Elio, scour the world for Stellarons and have obtained several. Their intentions are currently unclear; Kafka appears to know the Trailblazer's background and implanted a Stellaron in their body for an unknown reason.
                                        <br><br>
                                        It is speculated that the Antimatter Legion and Nanook the Destruction may be involved with the appearance of Stellarons. This is due to the frequent appearance of Stellarons shortly after these destroyers of universes appear on worlds. It is currently unknown if these occurrences are related or just coincidence.
                                        <br><br>
                                        This phenomenon is remarkably aggressive. It continues to encroach upon neighboring worlds in the form of a mysterious object, the Stellaron. It keeps spreading all over the universe like a cancerous growth, leading the Interastral Peace Corporation to call it "Cancer of All Worlds" and warning interstellar travelers not to take it lightly. The worlds swamped by the Cancer of All Worlds were soon beyond saving, and very few people survived.
                                        <br><br>
                                        There are many speculations regarding the Cancer of All Worlds, and most are related to Nanook the Destruction and the Antimatter Legion. These destroyers of universes often seemed to appear together with Stellarons. We do not yet know if these occurrences are related or are only coincidences.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Nobody has found a way to destroy a Stellaron. Currently, the most that can be done is contain its energy.

                                            Jarilo-VI is a planet that is frosted over due to the Eternal Freeze as a product of the Stellaron's effect on the planet. Its name may possibly be a mistranslation that has a poetry stanza number. Belobog currently stands as its only bastion where humanity thrives amidst the harsh climate.
